Hi there, this is Berna! I am a Ph.D. student at Max Planch Institute for Intelligent Systems interested in 3D Reconstruction, 3D Geometry & Graphics. I liked to read blogs over the years. Some of my favorite ones: [Peter Shirley's blog](http://psgraphics.blogspot.com/), [Matt Phar's blog](https://pharr.org/matt/blog/), and [Lilian's Blog](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/).
